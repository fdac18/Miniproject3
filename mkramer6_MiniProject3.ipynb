    "#General Hypothesis:\n",
    "#For This Project, I wanted to create a model to test if the amount of experience the Programmer had,\n",
    "#the more likely they were to select \"Familiarirty of packages\" as a higher priority. To do this I selected all \n",
    "#questions that related to experience on a project, such as age, number of commits, and years experience in the field.\n",
    "#I believe this could be a noticable trend due more experienced developers naturally knowing more material due to time.\n",
    "#Based on the answer given in each of these questions, I gave the developer a score that reflects how long they have been in\n",
    "#the industry. Afterwards, I want to plot the data using a linear regression to see if there is a trend. Beyond this, \n",
    "#I also wanted to see if there is any correlation with R and \"Familiarity with packages\" since it is a library heavy language.\n",
    "# Lastly, I wanted to see the value Data Scientists put on \"Familiarity with packages.\" For both of these sections, I performed\n",
    "#a logistical regression to visualize both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Descriptive analysis of Proposed Measures:\n",
    "#\"Familiarity with Packages\" is one of the higher prioritized subjects out of the choices on the list. This can be affected by \n",
    "#things such as age or experience due to those who have more experience typically has more pre-existing knowledge. Other factors could\n",
    "#include whether or not the programmer uses package heavy languages or not due to programmers knowing packages while using these\n",
    "#languages could complete a task quicker. Lastly, something that could affect this would be the discipline the programmer is in\n",
    "#due to some disciplines heavily using package heavy languages over other. \n",
