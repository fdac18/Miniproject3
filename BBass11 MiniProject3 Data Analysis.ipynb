Factor variables with more than 15 levels were eliminated from the dataset and remaining factor varaibles were converted to dummy variables. The log(x+1) of numeric values was taken to more evenly distrubute the data and prevent inf values. This transformation brought MAE from 3.4 to below 1. A small hyperparameter search was done using repeated cross validation with the only hyperparameter being number of variables tried at each split with this being 120.\n",
