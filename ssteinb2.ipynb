    "The model has a 76.6% degree of variability, and a residual error of 0.82. Additionally, it is worth noting that the predictors coefficients are small and that the distribution between negative and positive values is pretty even. The very small p-value (statistical significance), suggests that my data is unlikely to be correlated with a true NULL hypothesis and that the random sampling error was very small. Correaltion is about two variables 'moving together' in a direction or path. The higher the correlation, the stronger the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In turns out that my hypothesis was correct and the reputation of the author does in fact matter to survey takers. To do this, it consisted of parsing data and then interpreting it. Using R functions like select(), filter(), and reading into models I was able to handle the data. Above each of my code cells is a cell with a short but 'to the point' description of each required aspect of the project, along with the required output below.  \n"

This would make it so incomplete answers do not need to be filtered and would be a much cleaner set of data to work with. Additionally, there are some survey takers that take a disproportionate amount of time to answer. Perhaps the survey could time-out after a set time and the answers be omitted."
