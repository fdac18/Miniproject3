    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "My response variable is **Issue backlog** (PG5_2BNUI). I think the priority of this variable is going to be affected by the survey question: *In how many many software projects have you been involved?* (PG9Resp). The reasoning behind this is that developers who have been on more projects have probably used a larger variety of packages. As a result, they are likely to have more insight into which packages they prefer vs. packages they have used in the past that were not as successful for their project(s). Thus, I think survey takers who have been involved more projects will place **Issue backlog** as a higher priority than others. Also, PG8Resp (Type of developer) might also play a role because Software Developers might have a lot more exposure to VCS systems like GitHub while Data Scientists might not have to interact with them as much.\n"

    "The results of our second model above show that my hypothesis is not supported because the PG9Resp question was not the most significant when predicting my response variable. In fact, PG6Resp was one of the most signficant predictors (development experience), along with PG7R and PG8Resp. To me, these other predictors make a lot of sense and do not seem arbitrary (i.e. The more development experience someone has, the more likely they have been exposed to a variety of packages and libraries. This is a similar premise I had with my hypothesis and PG9Resp (number of projects involved with)). However, I did only use a linear model, which might not be the best for a categorical survey like this, and could have seen different results using another model like Random Forest."
